intel.xdk.camera
================

For capturing images with the camera and accessing those images.

Description
-----------

The camera object consists of several methods to control the capturing and
maintenance of picture files. The camera object contains a list of photos known
as the "picture list". The picture list is where new images are placed once they
are created.

There are several methods in the camera object that allow the application to
control the files in this list. The application may add to the picture list by
capturing a photo from the device's native camera using
[camera.takePicture](#takepicture), a picture may be added to the list by
referencing a file on the device using [camera.importPicture](#importpicture),
all the photos on the list may be listed in an array using
[camera.getPictureList](#getpicturelist), photos may be removed from the list
singly using [camera.deletePicture](#deletepicture), or the picture list may be
wiped clear using [camera.clearPictures](#clearpictures). Finally, files in the
picture list may be referenced for use in an application using the
[camera.getPictureURL](#getpictureurl) method.

### Methods

-   [clearPictures](#clearpictures) — This command will remove all photos from
    your application's picture list.
-   [deletePicture](#deletepicture) — Use this command to remove a photo from
    your application's picture list.
-   [getPictureList](#getpicturelist) — This command will return a list of all
    pictures stored in the application's picture list.
-   [getPictureURL](#getpictureurl) — This command will return the URL of the
    picture on the local webserver.
-   [importPicture](#importpicture) — This method will move a photo from your
    application's native camera file service (e.g. the camera roll) to the
    picture list.
-   [takePicture](#takepicture) — Use this command to take a picture with your
    device's camera.

### Events

-   [picture.add](#pictureadd) — Fired when a photo is added to the
    application's picture list
-   [picture.busy](#picturebusy) — Fired when accessing the native camera
    functionality is blocked by another process
-   [picture.cancel](#picturecancel) — Fired when the user chooses to cancel
    rather than taking or importing a picture
-   [picture.clear](#pictureclear) — Fired when the application's picture list
    has been cleared
-   [picture.remove](#pictureremove) — Fired when a photo is removed from
    application's picture list

### takePicture

Use this command to take a picture with your device's camera.

```javascript
intel.xdk.camera.takePicture(quality, saveToLibrary, pictureType);
```

#### Description

When this command is called, the native camera application for the device will

    a value between 1 and 100. The default value is 70.
-   **saveToLibrary:** This parameter controls whether the photo is saved
    directly to the device's image library or not. It should be a boolean value
    (i.e. true or false). The default value is true.
-   **pictureType:** The parameter controls the file type the photo can be saved
    as. The valid string values are "jpg" and "png" respectively. The default
    value is "jpg".

#### Events

-   **[intel.xdk.camera.picture.add](#pictureadd):** This event is fired once
    the takePicture method has completed. It will return parameters indicating
    whether it was successful or not, as well as the filename of the newly
    captured photo.
-   **[intel.xdk.camera.picture.busy](#picturebusy):** This event will be fired
    if the camera.takePicture method is called while another process is blocking
    access to the camera.
-   **[intel.xdk.camera.picture.cancel](#picturecancel):** This event will be
    fired if the native camera functionality is cancelled without taking a
    photo.

#### Example

```javascript
document.addEventListener("intel.xdk.camera.picture.add",onSuccess);
document.addEventListener("intel.xdk.camera.picture.busy",onSuccess);
document.addEventListener("intel.xdk.camera.picture.cancel",onSuccess);

function capturePhoto() {
  intel.xdk.camera.takePicture(50,false,"jpg");
}

function onSuccess(evt) {

  if (evt.success == true)
  {
    // create image
    var image = document.createElement('img');
